# 🐍 My Python Journey Toward Data Science

This repo documents my learning journey in Python — from the first variable I created to exploring advanced concepts like OOP, decorators, and comprehensions.

## 📘 Structure
Each folder represents a learning milestone:
- `01_basics` → variables, data types, loops
- `02_data_structures` → lists, sets, tuples, dicts
- `03_functions` → functions, *args, **kwargs, decorators
- `04_oop` → classes, inheritance, encapsulation
- `05_advanced` → file handling, exceptions, lambda, map/filter

## 🚀 Next Steps
I'll soon add:
- `06_numpy_pandas` → for data cleaning and analysis
- `07_projects` → mini data science projects

## 🧠 Tools
- Python 3.12.3
- VS Code
- GitHub for version control

> This repo is part of my journey to become a Data Scientist. Feel free to explore and suggest improvements.
